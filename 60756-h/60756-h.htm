<p class="tb"><i>Waiilatpu is the site of the
mission founded among the
Cayuse Indians in 1836 by
Marcus and Narcissa Whitman.
After 11 years of ministering to
the Indians and assisting emigrants
on the Oregon Trail, these missionaries were killed and
their mission destroyed by the Indians whom they sought
to help. The Whitmans&rsquo; story of devotion, nobility, and
courage places them high among the pioneers who settled
the Far West.</i></p>
<p class="tb">In 1836 five people&mdash;Dr. Marcus and Narcissa Whitman,
the Reverend Henry and Eliza Spalding, and William
H. Gray&mdash;successfully crossed the North American
continent from New York State to the largely unknown
land called Oregon. At Waiilatpu and Lapwai, among
the Cayuse and Nez Perc&eacute; Indians, they founded the
first two missions on the Columbia Plateau. The trail
they followed, established by Indians and fur traders,
was later to be called the Oregon Trail.</p>
<p>Narcissa Whitman and Eliza Spalding were the first
white women to cross the continent; the Whitmans&rsquo; baby,
Alice Clarissa, was the first child born of United States
citizens in the Pacific Northwest. These two events inspired
many families to follow, for they proved that
homes could be successfully established in Oregon, a land
not yet belonging to the United States.</p>
<p>In the winter of 1842-43, Dr. Whitman rode across
the Rocky Mountains in a desperate journey to the East
to save the missions from closure. On his return to Oregon,
another chapter in the western expansion of this
Nation was added when he successfully encouraged and
helped to guide the first great wagon train of emigrants
to the Columbia River. The Whitmans&rsquo; mission
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
throughout its existence was a haven for the overland
traveler. Medical care, rest, and supplies were available
to all who came that way.</p>
<p>For 11 years, the Whitmans worked among the Cayuse
Indians, bringing them the principles of Christianity,
teaching them the rudiments of agriculture and letters,
and treating their diseases. Then, in a time of troubles
when two opposing forces failed to understand each other,
the mission effort ended in violence. In the tragic conclusion,
the lives of the Whitmans were an example of
selflessness, perseverance, and dedication to a cause.
Their story is symbolic of the great effort made by
Protestant and Catholic missionaries to Christianize and
civilize the Indians in the first half of the 19th century.
The missions represented one aspect of American expansion
into the vast, unknown lands of the Pacific Northwest.</p>

<h2 id="c1"><span class="small"><i>Call From the West</i></span></h2>
<p>In 1831 two neighboring tribes west of the Rocky
Mountains, the Nez Perc&eacute; and the Flathead, sent a delegation
of their tribesmen to St. Louis, Mo., to seek the
white man&rsquo;s religion.</p>
<p>Although their understanding of Christianity was slight
and confused, they were interested in learning about it.
Their own religion was associated with nature, and they
assigned power to natural objects. Their spiritual goal
was to attune themselves with nature so that they might
acquire power that would make them successful in war
or hunting. They sought this white man&rsquo;s religion because,
to their minds, it explained the great power possessed
by the whites; if they could acquire Christianity,
it would increase the power they already had.</p>
<p>In St. Louis the 4-man delegation visited William
Clark, superintendent of Indian Affairs, who had passed
through their country more than 25 years earlier as one
of the co-leaders of the memorable Lewis and Clark
Expedition. Myths and legends surround this visit to St.
Louis, and the complete story will probably never be
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
known. Yet, it seems probable that they sought the
white man&rsquo;s &ldquo;Book of Heaven&rdquo; and teachers to show them
how to read and write.</p>
<p>Their visit probably would have passed unnoticed had
not a man named William Walker become aware of it.
While visiting St. Louis in November 1832, he heard from
William Clark the story of the Indian visitors. Becoming
enthusiastic about helping the Indians of the far
Northwest to become Christians, Walker wrote to a New
York friend, G. P. Disoway, giving him a rather unusual
version of the facts.</p>
<p>He told how Clark had held a weighty theological
discussion with the Indians, despite the fact that they
could not speak English and no interpreter could be found
at the time. He claimed also to have seen the Indians
in the city, though two of the delegation had died and
the remaining pair had apparently departed 8 months
before Walker&rsquo;s arrival. He described them as &ldquo;small
in size, delicately formed, small limbed,&rdquo; and having flat
heads. This description hardly fits the stocky, well-built
Flathead and Nez Perc&eacute;, who did not flatten their heads.
The famous painter of the West, George Catlin, claimed
to have painted portraits of the two survivors of the delegation,
and these likenesses indicate the Indians were
normally developed. Disoway further flavored the
story, and it was printed in New York in the <i>Christian
Advocate and Journal</i>, a publication of the Methodist
Episcopal Church.</p>

</div>
<p>This call from the West was immediately heard by
various churches in the United States. Several missionary
organizations became active in finding men and
women to send to the Pacific Northwest as missionaries.
Among them were the Mission Society of the Methodist
Episcopal Church; the Roman Catholic Order of the
Society of Jesus; and the American Board of Commissioners
for Foreign Missions, then supported by the
Presbyterian, Congregational, and Dutch Reformed
Churches.</p>
<p>The first to respond was the Methodists&rsquo; Mission Society.
In 1834 Jason Lee and four associates joined the
Wyeth Expedition and headed for the Northwest. Lee
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
did not stop in Flathead or Nez Perc&eacute; country but went
on to the lower Columbia and selected a site in the beautiful
Willamette Valley. The Methodists established their
mission near a small French Canadian farming settlement
close to present-day Salem, Oreg. These settlers, who
originally were trappers for the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company,
had turned to farming when the fur trade declined.</p>
<p>Reinforced with 13 new workers in 1836 and 50 additional
persons in 1838, the Methodists began missions
at The Dalles, the Clatsop Plains, Fort Nisqually, the
Falls of the Willamette, and Chemeketa&mdash;now Salem.</p>

</div>
<p>Their work among the coastal Indians was not very
successful. New diseases brought by the whites were
fatal to these tribes, and the number of Indians along the
Willamette and lower valleys was rapidly declining.
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
Also, they simply were not interested in the &ldquo;Book of
Heaven.&rdquo; Those who attended services wanted to be
paid for coming, for it was not these people who had
asked for missionaries. Although Jason Lee was the first
missionary, the Nez Perc&eacute; and the Flatheads were still
awaiting a response to their call. The answer was soon
to be supplied by another group of missionaries.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have had an interview with the Rev.

mission or beyond the Rocky Mountains.&rdquo;
<span class="lr">Marcus Whitman,</span>
<span class="lr">Dec. 2, 1834.</span></p>
</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small"><i>Samuel Parker and the American Board</i></span></h2>
<p>Another man influenced by the Indians&rsquo; call was the
Reverend Samuel Parker, pastor of the Congregational
Church in Middlefield, Mass. Though 54 years of age,
married, and the father of three children, Parker volunteered
to the American Board of Commissioners for
Foreign Missions to go to the Flathead country. Turned
down by the Board, Parker moved to Ithaca, N.Y. Early
in 1834, he spoke at a special meeting in the Ithaca Presbyterian
Church and aroused the congregation to such
a high pitch that it was proposed that Parker go to
Oregon to select mission sites. This time Parker was able
to get the support of the American Board for the undertaking.</p>
<p>Knowing little more about the Pacific Northwest than
its general direction, Parker set out in the spring of 1834;
but he and two companions arrived at St. Louis too late
to accompany the fur-traders&rsquo; annual caravan to the
Rockies. It was risky to undertake the trip alone, so
Parker returned to New York to raise money and recruits
for the next year. In December 1834 he reported to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
American Board that a Dr. Marcus Whitman had volunteered
to serve as a medical missionary.</p>
<p>In 1835 Parker and his new recruit, Marcus Whitman,
joined the fur-traders&rsquo; caravan and headed westward.
Not until cholera had broken out and Dr. Whitman&rsquo;s
medical skill had prevented disaster in the caravan did
the unholy traders appreciate having the missionaries in
their group. On August 12 the party reached the fur-trading
rendezvous, which was held that year near the
junction of Horse Creek and the Green River in Wyoming.
There, once again Whitman was able to display
his medical skill. He successfully removed a 3-inch iron
arrowhead from the back of the famous mountain man,
Jim Bridger, under the watchful eyes of traders, mountain
men, and Indians. This exhibition of competence was
not lost on the Nez Perc&eacute; and Flathead. Parker and
Whitman talked to them and found that they were
indeed anxious to have missions.</p>
<p>To get the missions established by the next year, Whitman
decided to return East and organize volunteers for
the new field. Parker was to continue on to Oregon,
explore for mission locations, and meet Whitman&rsquo;s party
when it reached the rendezvous the next summer.</p>
<p>Parker, traveling with the Nez Perc&eacute;, reached their
homeland on the Clearwater River in present Idaho late
in September. Thence he went down the Columbia
River to Fort Vancouver, where he spent most of the
winter with the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company traders. During
the winter and the next spring, he made several trips of
exploration in the country between the Clearwater and
the Willamette. In the spring of 1836, he learned that
the Nez Perc&eacute; were returning to the rendezvous by a
northerly, rugged route. Parker, feeling his years at last,
decided to return to the United States by sea. Before the
Indians&rsquo; departure, he wrote letters for them to carry to
the rendezvous. Although Whitman received these letters,
it is doubtful if they contained any information of
value to the 1836 American Board party. While Parker
was at Fort Vancouver, Marcus Whitman, back in New
York, had been busy gathering men and money in order
to establish the missions in the Oregon country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="555" />
<p class="pcap">Marcus Whitman&rsquo;s certificate appointed him &ldquo;an assistant missionary
to Indian tribes West of the State of Missouri.&rdquo; It was also necessary
for the missionaries to get permission from the Secretary of War
to visit the Indian lands of western United States.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small"><i>&ldquo;We Want You for Oregon&rdquo;</i></span></h2>
<p>On his return trip from the rendezvous in 1835, Whitman
wrote to Rev. David Greene, one of the secretaries
of the American Board, about the need for recruits for
Oregon. Greene in his reply told Whitman about two
missionaries who had volunteered for the West; he also
cautioned Whitman against taking a bride into the
wilderness.</p>
<p>As it turned out, neither of the two ministers was able
to go to Oregon. But when he arrived home, Whitman
learned of a third minister, Henry Spalding, who had just
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
been appointed to a mission in western Missouri. In
answer to Whitman&rsquo;s query, Spalding was willing to
change his destination to Oregon, provided that the Board
approved.</p>
<p>The year 1835 came to an end without any definite
word from the American Board concerning the Spaldings
or anyone else. Greene forwarded some good news, however,
when he wrote that the Board now approved of
women going to Oregon. Since Whitman had become
engaged to a Miss Narcissa Prentiss prior to going west
with Parker, this word was indeed welcomed. A few
days later the Board decided that there should be a total
of five in the party for Oregon: Dr. Whitman, an ordained
minister, their wives, and a layman to serve as
farmer and mechanic. The one limitation was that no
children could be taken.</p>
<p>In writing Greene of his lack of success in getting recruits,
Whitman again mentioned the Spaldings as a
possibility. Greene replied that the Spaldings were ineligible
because they had a child. Whitman hastened to
write that the Spaldings had lost their only baby. Greene&rsquo;s
reply to this was vague. Although he did not directly
state that the Spaldings could go, he noted that he did not
know who else would be available.</p>

<p>This was enough for Whitman to act upon. He immediately
went to Prattsburg, N. Y., to tell Henry Spalding
the news. But he was too late. Spalding had just
departed for his post in Missouri. Undismayed, Whitman
gave chase and overtook the Spaldings on the road,
reportedly exclaiming, &ldquo;We want you for Oregon.&rdquo;
Henry and Eliza accepted the call and continued on to
wait for Whitman in Cincinnati. Whitman returned
home for his wedding.</p>
<p>On February 18, 1836, Marcus Whitman married Narcissa
Prentiss. The ceremony closed with the hymn,
&ldquo;Yes, My Native Land! I Love Thee.&rdquo; This proved to
be too emotional for the congregation. Knowing that
the couple was leaving in the morning for distant Oregon,
those present, one by one, faltered in the singing. By
the time the last stanza was reached, sobs could be heard
throughout the church. Only Narcissa&rsquo;s voice was heard
as she finished the last lines:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Let me hasten</p>
<p class="t0">Far in heathen lands to dwell.</p>
</div>
<p>The call had finally been heard. The Whitmans began
the long trip to the land beyond the Rockies.</p>

</div>
<p>On March 31, 1836, the Whitmans and Spaldings left
St. Louis aboard the <i>Chariton</i> for Liberty, Mo., the
jumping-off place for the West. In Liberty they were
joined by the fifth member of the party, William H. Gray.</p>
<p>Marcus Whitman&rsquo;s experience, gained in the preceding
year on his trip to the Rockies, together with his dedication
to the purpose of the trip, made him the natural
leader of the little group. Born in 1802 in Rushville,
N.Y., Marcus was 8 when his father died, and the boy
then went to live with an uncle. Following classical
school, he had hoped to prepare for the ministry. But a
lack of money and his family&rsquo;s disinterest in this career
caused him to turn to medicine.</p>
<p>Whitman began riding with the local doctor, and in
1825 he entered a medical school in Fairfield, N.Y. Following
practice in New York and Canada, Whitman
settled in the town of Wheeler, N.Y. Before long, he
became interested in medical missionary work. He concluded
that his medical training and religious interests
could be well combined in this field. His first application
to the American Board for a mission assignment was
turned down because of poor health. But after Dr.
Samuel Parker interviewed him in 1835, the Board reconsidered
and selected Marcus as a medical missionary.</p>
<p>Narcissa Whitman was in many ways a contrast to
her husband. Though he was sober and serious, Narcissa
was animated and vivacious. Attractive in face
and figure, endowed with a fine voice, she was a person
of confidence and poise. Born in Prattsburg, N.Y., in
1808, Narcissa Prentiss attended Emma Willard&rsquo;s &ldquo;Female
Seminary&rdquo; in Troy and afterwards Franklin
Academy in Prattsburg. She taught school for several
years and then applied for the mission field. In her first
attempt she too was turned down by the Board. It did
not want single women for missionary work. But after
her engagement to Marcus, the Board approved her application.
The trip to Oregon was her honeymoon.</p>
<p>Riding with Marcus and Narcissa was a man whose
marriage proposal Mrs. Whitman is said to have once
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
turned down, the Reverend Henry Harmon Spalding.
Spalding was born at Bath, N.Y., in 1803, the child of
an unwed mother. Bound out to foster parents at 14
months, he endured an unhappy childhood. The jeers
and name-calling to which he was subjected by his stepfather
and others left a bitter memory. By nature he
was shy, quick tempered, and impatient with those who
disagreed with him.</p>
<p>Spalding attended Franklin Academy, where he first
met Narcissa Prentiss. After Franklin, he attended
Western Reserve College in Hudson, Ohio and Lane
Theological Seminary in Cincinnati. Upon completion
of his studies, he was ordained in the Presbyterian Church.
In 1831 he met Eliza Hart of Holland Patent, N.Y., and
they were soon married.</p>
<p>Born in 1807 in Kensington, Conn., Eliza Hart grew
into a studious and deeply religious person. In appearance
she was tall, dark, and coarse of feature and voice;
but she had a quiet charm that endeared her to those
who knew her. Of them all, Eliza was best fitted by
temperament to work among the Indians, but even she
did not realize that the Indians&rsquo; first loyalty was to themselves
and not to the whites and their ways.</p>
<p>William H. Gray, appointed to the Oregon mission as
mechanic and carpenter, was born in Fairfield, N.Y., in
1810. His father died when William was 16, and he
was apprenticed to a cabinetmaker. His best talents
were in the use of his hands, but his ambitions always
exceeded ordinary callings. His manual skills were to be
of value to the missionaries, but his undependable temper
and habit of complaining were to lead to serious complications
for the missions of Oregon.</p>
<p>At Liberty, Mo., these five now made their final preparations
for the trip across the Great Plains and over
the Rockies to the still-strange land called Oregon in order
to bring their faith to the Indians.</p>
<div class="box">
<p>The camera had not
made its appearance in
the Pacific Northwest
before the deaths of
Marcus and Narcissa
Whitman. Though
artists visited the mission
before the massacre,
no known likenesses
of the Whitmans
have ever been found.
Thus the few sketches
that have been made
of Marcus and his wife
are conjectural drawings,
the better ones
based on descriptions
written by those who
knew them.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small"><i>The Oregon Country</i></span></h2>
<p>The tide of European adventurers and explorers had
long pressed upon the Pacific Northwest coast. Britain,
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
France, Russia, Spain, and that fledgling nation, the
United States, made claims along the rock-strewn shores
as they searched for the elusive Northwest Passage between
the two oceans and grasped for the wealth offered
by the pelts of the sea otter.</p>
<p>Early in the 19th century overland explorers from
Britain and the United States began mapping the vast
area that stretched from the Rocky Mountains to the
Pacific and from the Russian settlements in the north to
Spanish California. This was the Oregon Country.
Alexander Mackenzie, Simon Fraser, and David Thompson
made their way overland for the British crown. In
1804 President Thomas Jefferson sent an expedition led
by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark to find a route
to the Pacific.</p>

</div>
<p>Soon came the fur-trading companies, competing furiously
for beaver pelts and thereby exploring much of the
Northwest and strengthening national claims. Working
its way down the Columbia River, the Canadian-based
North West Company dominated the area between 1807
and 1821. John Jacob Astor challenged it briefly when
his Pacific Fur Company established Fort Astoria at the
mouth of the Columbia. In the American Rockies another
company organized by Astor, the American Fur
Company, obtained a virtual monopoly in that region
by 1835.</p>

<h3><i>Narcissa Whitman&rsquo;s Letters</i></h3>
<p><i>Mary Walker, who was a prolific writer herself, once
recorded in her diary a cutting remark about Narcissa
Whitman spending too much time writing letters home.
But it is from Mrs. Whitman&rsquo;s detailed and fascinating
letters that we get a close view of the lives of the missionaries
in Oregon. Highly intelligent and a keen observer,
Narcissa Whitman was able to capture the color and drama
of her trip west and life among the Indians. Although
her letters increasingly recounted moments of melancholy
and loneliness, they also disclosed a lively, vivacious
woman who was blessed with a fine sense of humor.</i></p>
<p><i>Her diary&mdash;really a series of letters written while crossing
the continent&mdash;reveals clearly a lady of charm who
was interested in all things and people who came her way.
Later, in the Pacific Northwest, when death had taken
her only child and it became clear the Cayuse were not
interested in Christianity, Mrs. Whitman&rsquo;s letters show
her deep worry over her role in the mission field. At
times she despaired of her own worth and wished she
could give her place to others. It is likely, however, that
she did not realize her own intelligence and relatively
sophisticated personality were a barrier between her and
the Indians. A friend wrote after her death that the Indians
considered Mrs. Whitman to be remote and
haughty. He added that this was not her fault; it was
her misfortune.</i></p>

<p><i>Dearest Mother. We commenced our journey to Walla Walla July 18th 1825.
Under the protection of Mr. McLeod, &amp; his company. Came ten miles, in a southwestern
direction. The Flat Head or Nez Perce Indians &amp; some lodges of the Snake tribe, accompanying
us to Port Half White&mdash;they are with us, we shall make but one camp in a day.
On the 19<sup>th</sup> we did not move at all. 20<sup>th</sup> Came twelve miles in the same direction, as
on the 18<sup>th</sup> over many steep &amp; high mountains. On the 21<sup>st</sup> our course was southeast in
the morning. Traveled fifteen miles. Yesterday the 22<sup>d</sup> was a tedious day to us, we started
about nine o&rsquo;clock And rode untill half past four, PM. Came twenty one miles. Had
two short showers in the afternoon which cooled the air considerably, before this, the
heat was oppressive. I thought of Mother&rsquo;s bread &amp; butter many times are as any hungry
child would, but did not find it on the way. I fancy pork &amp; potatoes would relish
extremely well. Have been living on fresh meat for two months exclusively. Am cloyed
with it. I do not know how I shall endure this part of the journey. Find it much harder
to make one camp in the day, than we did to make two, while with Fish
for our dinner and two hours rest in the heat of the day, prepared us for a lengthy
ride in the afternoon. Our ride to day has not been so fatiguing or lengthy as yesterday.
Rode from nine o&rsquo;clock AM. until one o&rsquo;clock PM in the same direction, south west as yesterday.
Felt a calm and peaceful state of mind all day. How sweet communion with him who
delights to dwell with the humble &amp; contrite heart, in heart. Especial in the morning I
had a freedom in prayer for my beloved parents. Earnestly desired that God would bless them</i></p>

<p>But the giant of all the trading firms was the Hudson&rsquo;s
Bay Company. Growing steadily larger, it merged with
the North West Company in 1821 and thereby inherited
the fur wealth of the Oregon Country.</p>
<p>In the early 19th century, many Americans believed
that the western boundary of the United States should
be the Pacific. They also believed that the northern
boundary west of the Rockies should be set at least as far
north as the 49th parallel. But Britain was not willing
to give up its interests on the lower Columbia. In 1818
the two countries agreed to a temporary arrangement
for joint occupation of the whole area. Citizens and
subjects of the two nations could enter the Oregon Country
without affecting either nation&rsquo;s claims. The United
States also reached agreements with Spain and Russia
that resulted in these two countries surrendering all claims
to the land between California and Alaska.</p>

</div>
<p>Despite the joint-occupation agreement, the Hudson&rsquo;s
Bay Company was in almost complete control of Oregon
after 1821. The United States, however, was able to
keep alive its claims through the activities of some of its
more colorful citizens. In 1828 the magnificent trailblazer
Jedediah Smith visited Fort Vancouver, the Columbia
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
headquarters of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company. A
few years later Capt. Benjamin Bonneville explored and
trapped the western slopes of the Rockies. In 1832 and
1834 Nathaniel Wyeth attempted unsuccessfully to establish
a permanent foothold on the Columbia River.</p>
<p>This was the Oregon Country to which the missionaries
came. Other than the scattered Hudson&rsquo;s Bay forts
and a handful of settlers near Fort Vancouver, the vast
land was empty except for the transient trappers and, of
course, the Indians.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small"><i>The Trip West</i></span></h2>
<p>Spalding and Gray, driving the livestock overland, set
out from Liberty on April 28, 1836. Whitman and the
two wives waited for a steamer to take them to the assembly
point of the American Fur Company caravan
farther upriver. But the steamboat failed to stop, and
Whitman had to hire a wagon and make a hurried pursuit
of Spalding. Reunited, the missionaries caught up
with the caravan near the junction of the Platte River and
the Loup Fork in Nebraska on May 26.</p>
<p>Traveling 15 to 20 miles a day, the caravan crossed the
dusty plains toward Fort Laramie. There the missionaries
left the heavy wagon and, discarding excess baggage,
repacked their goods on animals. They decided to take
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
Spalding&rsquo;s light wagon as far as they possibly could.</p>
<p>On July 4 the caravan crossed the Continental Divide
at South Pass and, 2 days later, reached that year&rsquo;s fur-trapper
rendezvous on the Green River, near Daniel,
Wyo. While Narcissa enjoyed the excitement and tumult
of the colorful affair, the quieter Eliza concentrated on
learning the Indians&rsquo; languages.</p>
<p>Dismayed by Parker&rsquo;s failure to return to the rendezvous,
the missionaries were relieved by the unexpected
arrival of two Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company traders, John
McLeod and Thomas McKay. Guided by these two
experienced men, the missionaries set out on the 700-mile
journey through sagebrush, desert, canyons, and mountains
to the Columbia. Stopping at Nathaniel Wyeth&rsquo;s
Fort Hall only overnight, the party moved westward along
the south bank of the Snake River. The wagon finally
broke down, and the men had to convert it into a two-wheeled
cart. Two weeks later on August 19, they
reached Fort Boise, a Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company post on
the Snake River.</p>
<p>No wagon or cart had ever come this far west before,
but here Whitman and Spalding were finally forced to
abandon their cart. After a few days&rsquo; rest, the party
moved on. Following the Powder River and crossing
the beautiful Grande Ronde Valley, the missionaries
reached the rugged, twisted Blue Mountains. Riding
ahead to the crest, the Whitmans had their first view of
the Columbia valley with majestic Mount Hood on the
far horizon.</p>
<p>On the morning of September 1, the Whitmans excitedly
galloped up to the gate of Fort Walla Walla, the
Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company post on the Columbia. They
were met by Pierre Pambrun, the chief trader, who was
to be their near and good neighbor for the next few years.
Two days later the Spaldings arrived with the livestock.</p>
<p>Needing household goods and wanting to meet the
Chief Factor, Dr. John McLoughlin, the party decided
to go to the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company western headquarters
at Fort Vancouver, more than 200 miles down the Columbia.
Reaching the fort by boat on September 12,
the missionaries completed their long journey 207 days
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
after their departure from Angelica, N. Y. On the move
for more than 6 months, and traveling more than 3,000
miles, Narcissa Whitman and Eliza Spalding had crossed
the North American Continent&mdash;the first white women
to do so.</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small"><i>A Welcome At Fort Vancouver</i></span></h2>
<p>The stern but kindly Dr. McLoughlin gave the missionaries
a warm welcome. He appreciated the significance
of the ladies&rsquo; successful journey across the continent.
While complimenting them on this, he must have thought
to himself that they were but the vanguard of many
American families to follow.</p>

<p class="pcap">Dr. John McLoughlin, Chief Factor of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company
in Oregon, exercised vast sway over an area extending from British
Columbia to western Montana. Physically a giant and of an imperious
nature, he was to the Indians &ldquo;The White Eagle.&rdquo; On
their arrival at Fort Vancouver Narcissa wrote: &ldquo;I feel I have come
to a father&rsquo;s house indeed, even in a strange land has the Lord
raised up friends.&rdquo;

</div>
<p>To the surprise of the party, McLoughlin&rsquo;s stores contained
most of the articles needed to establish the missions:
household furniture, clothing, building supplies, books
and provisions; all were for sale. Narcissa wrote home
that it was not necessary to bring anything from the
East, for everything could be found at Fort Vancouver,
&ldquo;the New York of the Pacific Ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the ladies enjoyed the hospitality of the fort,
Whitman, Gray, and Spalding went back up the Columbia
to select their mission sites. With their husbands away,
the two women caught up on their correspondence, sewed
clothing, and picked out the household utensils they would
need. Narcissa spent her evenings singing to the children
at the fort school. On November 3 Spalding returned
to escort Narcissa and Eliza to their new homes in the
interior.</p>
<p>If McLoughlin had been cool toward the missionaries,
such behavior could have been justified. The influx
of Americans that was bound to follow would inevitably
change Oregon. British control would then be threatened
and fur trade profits reduced. Nevertheless, McLoughlin,
Pambrun, and other Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company
people extended a helping hand to the missionaries.
Such success as the missions had in the Pacific Northwest
was due, in good part, to the assistance they received from
the company.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small"><i>Starting a New Life</i></span></h2>
<p>On the north bank of the Walla Walla River, 22 miles
upstream from its junction with the Columbia, Marcus
Whitman selected the site of his mission on the lands of
the Cayuse Indians. Henry Spalding picked a site 110
miles to the east on Lapwai Creek, 2 miles from its confluence
with the Clearwater; the Nez Perc&eacute; tribe at last
had a missionary.</p>
<p>Whitman selected <i>Wai-i-lat-pu</i>, &ldquo;the place of the rye
grass,&rdquo; for several reasons. Close to Fort Walla Walla
at the mouth of the river, Waiilatpu was near both a
source of supply and the main travel route between
Canada and Fort Vancouver. Whitman must have realized,
too, that its location was on the line of march between
South Pass in the Rockies and the Columbia, the
trail that Americans would surely follow. In addition,
it was the home of the Cayuse Indians, a &ldquo;heathen&rdquo; tribe
that in the minds of the missionaries needed to be saved
as much as any.</p>
<p>For his wife&rsquo;s arrival from Fort Vancouver, Whitman
built a crude log lean-to as a shelter against the oncoming
winter. When Narcissa arrived at Waiilatpu on December
10, she found that the little structure had two bedrooms,
a kitchen, a pantry, and a fireplace, but was
still without windows and doors. Narcissa, though expecting
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
her first child, accepted her lot in good humor
and set out to make a home. Meanwhile, Whitman,
Gray, and their helpers worked steadily on the main part
of this first house.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig13">
<img src="images/p12.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="535" />
<p class="pcap">This photograph of the Spalding mission cabin
at Lapwai&mdash;now called Spalding&mdash;was taken in 1900.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Because of the scarcity of suitable timber, the main part
of the one-and-a-half story house was made of sun-dried
adobe bricks. With great difficulty, enough pine boards
were whipsawed in the Blue Mountains 20 miles away to
make the floor. The roof was made of poles covered
with earth and rye grass. From the cottonwoods that
grew along the river, some furniture was made. Pierre
Pambrun contributed by sending a small heating stove
and a rocking chair from Fort Walla Walla. Bedsteads
were boards nailed to walls, and, except for a feather tick
Narcissa had acquired at Fort Vancouver, corn husks and
blankets served as mattresses.</p>
<p>But even before it was finished, the first house was
flooded by the Walla Walla River, just a few feet away.
After a second flood, Whitman reluctantly decided that
it would be necessary to build again on higher ground.
Work was begun on the new <span class="ss">T</span>-shaped mission house in
1838. A few years later, the abandoned first house was
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
torn down, and its adobe bricks were used to build a
blacksmith shop.</p>
<p>During the first year, the missionaries depended on the
Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company for provisions to tide them over
to their first harvest. From Fort Vancouver, Fort Walla
Walla, and Fort Colville (in northeastern Washington),
they bought pork, flour, butter, corn, and potatoes. Occasionally
the Indians sold them fish and venison.</p>
<p>Horses purchased from the Cayuse provided steaks and
stews. As Dr. Whitman put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we have killed and eaten twenty-three or
four horses since we have been here, not that
we suffered which causes us to eat them, but if
we had not eaten them, we would have suffered....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the spring of 1837 the first plantings of vegetables and
grains were made. Also in that first year, both Spalding
and Whitman planted apple orchards.</p>
<p>At the same time, the missionaries began their efforts
among the Indians. Both men encouraged the Cayuse
and Nez Perc&eacute; to start cultivation of the soil. Although
the Cayuse had an epidemic of sickness at this time, some
of the families did plant crops before departing for the
hill valleys to dig camas bulbs in the early summer of
1837. Whitman was greatly encouraged by this hesitant
start. He wrote: &ldquo;When they have plenty of food they
will be little disposed to wander.&rdquo; He greatly desired to
lead them from their nomadic ways and to have them
establish settled communities. But the Indians lacked
skills and tools, and the results of their farming were far
less than either their enthusiasm or the missionaries&rsquo;
expectations.</p>
<p>Both stations also began educational, spiritual, and
medical work. Spalding and Whitman were preachers,
teachers, doctors, and farmers; and Narcissa and Eliza
assisted them in all these phases of their work.</p>
<p>Since the Nez Perc&eacute; tongue was understood by both
tribes, it was used as the language of instruction at both
stations. This meant that only one alphabet had to be
devised and that the same written material could be used
at both missions. Henry and Eliza Spalding made the
most progress in mastering the difficult Indian tongue, and
they took the lead in forming the alphabet and translating
material. However, by the autumn of 1837 Marcus and
Narcissa had learned enough Nez Perc&eacute; to begin their
school.</p>

<p><i>Nez Perc&eacute;</i></p>
<p><i>The Nez Perc&eacute; Indians called themselves the Nimipu,
&ldquo;The People.&rdquo; Lewis and Clark, the first whites to travel
through the Nez Perc&eacute; country, called them by two names,
the Chopunnish and the Pierced Nose Indians. But
available records indicate that very few, if any, of these
Indians pierced their noses. Such a custom was common
with the Pacific Coast tribes who decorated their noses
with sea shells.</i></p>
<p><i>Within a few years after Lewis and Clark traveled
through present-day Idaho, some unknown person, probably
a French-Canadian trapper, changed Pierced Nose
to Nez Perc&eacute; and so the name has come down to us today.
The accent over the final &ldquo;e&rdquo; is no longer pronounced;
Nez is pronounced as it looks, Perc&eacute; is pronounced
&ldquo;purse.&rdquo; Though some writers no longer use the accent,
its usage is considered to be correct by most.</i></p>

<p class="tb"><span class="lr"><i class="small">continued from <a href="#Page_32">page 32</a></i></span></p>
<p>Religious instruction was commenced promptly at
both Waiilatpu and Lapwai. The Spaldings held daily
prayers and conducted worship on Sundays. Handicapped
by their slowness at learning the language, the
Whitmans resorted mainly to encouraging the Indians
to continue their daily prayer meetings, which some of
them, inspired by fur traders, had been attending before
the missionaries arrived.</p>
<p>Although Whitman was the trained doctor, Spalding
also administered to the sick. At first, the Indians were
receptive to white medicine; but it was medicine that
was later to become a major issue of contention between
the Indians and the missionaries. For the time being,
however, an encouraging start had been made. The Nez
Perc&eacute; seemed truly happy to have the Spaldings in their
midst, while the Cayuse, though less enthusiastic, accepted
the Whitmans at Waiilatpu. What were these people
like, whom man and wife had come 3,000 miles to convert
and civilize?</p>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small"><i>The Cayuse Indians</i></span></h2>
<p>The Cayuse tribe numbered little more than 400 when
the Whitmans settled among them. Located principally
on the upper Walla Walla and Umatilla Rivers, they
had many contacts with their neighbors, the Nez Perc&eacute;,
Walla Walla, and Umatilla Indians. They were related
to these tribes through marriage and through a common
culture. Originally of a different language family than
the surrounding tribes, the Cayuse were by 1836 an integrated
part of the Columbia plateau culture.</p>
<p>The social organization of the tribe was a loose one.
The basic unit was the family, which was headed by an
autocratic father whose decisions were final and whose
authority was independent of the chiefs or elders.
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
Several families formed a band, and several of
these bands made the tribe. There was no head chief
for the whole tribe; rather, each band had its own chief
who held his position by inheritance, merit, or wealth, or
by a combination of these. A chief was an influential
person, but he was not a dictator over the actions of his
band. For hunts or warfare, a chief would often turn
over his leadership to the most experienced hunters or
warriors. In addition, each band had a group of elders
who offered advice and, to some extent, managed the common
affairs of the band under the direction of the chief.</p>
<p>Like the Nez Perc&eacute;, the Cayuse were adept at selective
horse breeding. Large horse herds enriched the tribe and
gave it power that far exceeded its small size. The horses
also gave these Indians great mobility. In the appropriate
seasons, they crossed the mountains to the east to
hunt and rode down the Columbia to fish at Celilo Falls.</p>
<p>Hunts were composed of organized parties which pursued
deer, American elk, pronghorn, bison, and smaller
animals. Meat that was not eaten fresh was made into
a highly concentrated, nutritious pemmican. During the
salmon runs, nets, weirs, spears, hooks, and baskets were
all used to catch the big fish. The Cayuse women
roasted the fresh salmon on sticks or sun-dried, pulverized,
and packed the fish in baskets for winter use. In addition,
the Cayuse collected berries and roots in the mountains.
Berries were preserved by being pressed into dry
cakes or by being mixed with pemmican. Camas bulbs
were dug in large quantities, steamed in pits, and formed
into cakes that were dried in the sun. These cakes were
eaten as bread, boiled into mush, or cooked with meat.</p>
<p>The Plateau Indians, though excellent hunters, were
not as warlike as those on the Great Plains. Nonetheless,
they fought with skill and bravery when forced to do so.
The one traditional enemy of the Cayuse was the Snake
tribe, which lived to the southeast. According to the
Cayuse, the Snake people had forbidden them to hunt in
the Blue Mountains. In retaliation, the Cayuse attempted
to keep the Snakes from the fisheries and trading
places along the Columbia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>For generations the Northwest Indians had traded
among themselves. The Cayuse, with their wealth of
horses, played an active role in this trade. They exchanged
horses, robes, and reed mats for the shells,
trinkets, and root foods of the coastal Indians. After
the fur trade started, the Cayuse bartered their goods for
blankets, guns, and ammunition.</p>
<p>Early observers saw the Cayuse from different points
of view. Some considered them to be haughty, restless,
and perhaps undependable. Others were favorably impressed
by them. One such was Joel Palmer who wrote
in his journal in 1845:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These Indians have decidedly a better appearance
than any I have met; tall and athletic
in form, and of great symmetry of person; they
are generally well clad, and observe pride in personal
cleanliness....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In dress, the Cayuse were similar to all the Columbia
Indians. Lightly clad during the hot summer, they
dressed in the skins of deer, elk, and bighorn in the
winter. They protected their feet with moccasins, and
Cayuse men wore leather leggings. Clothing was commonly
decorated with fringes, feathers, quills, beads,
shells, and colored cloth. Some of these garments were
elaborate and extremely colorful. Following contacts
with the white traders, the Indians often supplemented
their costumes with articles of European manufacture.</p>
<p>Their homes were usually oblong lodges, from 15 to 60
feet in length. The larger lodges were multi-family
dwellings. Within the lodge, each family had its own
fire and a modicum of privacy. They also lived in tepees
of a style borrowed from the Plains Indians. The frames
of both lodge and tepee were covered with well-woven
reed mats or buffalo hides.</p>
<p>Since it was their wives who put up and took down
the lodges and tepees, and who did most of the work in
the village, the men were interested in finding a healthy,
strong wife. A man bought his wife, or wives, the price
often depending on her capacity for work. Should a
marriage not work out, it was a simple matter for either
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
the husband or wife to dissolve the marriage and go
separate ways. Prostitution was rare, and wives were
generally more faithful than those of the coast Indians.</p>

<p>The Cayuse and other tribes of the Columbia Plateau
made their first contact with Christianity through fur
traders. Many of the employees of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay
Company were Roman Catholics&mdash;French Canadians
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
and Iroquois. Although the company did not at first
bring priests into Oregon for its employees, the Indians
learned a little about the new faith from these Hudson&rsquo;s
Bay men. Also, the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company sent a few
Indian boys to an Anglican mission school at the Red
River Settlement in Canada.</p>
<p>These were the Indians among whom the Whitmans
settled. Proud of their heritage, the Cayuse were yet interested
in new things and the new ideas that the Whitmans
introduced. Because of their age-old beliefs, they
were not willing to completely surrender their own way
of life.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig19">

<p class="pcap">J. M. Stanley sketched this view of the Tshimakain

</div>
<p>The arrival of the missionaries resulted in new stresses
and emotions among the Cayuse. Problems were created
which neither the Indians nor the whites fully understood.
Previously the Cayuse had been able to survive the challenges
of their environment. But the old ways were to
prove inadequate in surmounting the new difficulties,
real or imagined, that arose with the coming of the white
man. The missionaries, too, found much that was
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
strange in their new surroundings and strove to adjust
themselves to the primitive land.</p>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small"><i>Reinforcements for Oregon</i></span></h2>
<p>Their first, short winter at Waiilatpu passed swiftly
for the missionaries. But by summer a dissatisfied and
restless William Gray left Oregon, without Whitman&rsquo;s
knowledge but with Spalding&rsquo;s approval, to visit the East.
Gray was unhappy with his position of mechanic and
helper to the mission. He was ambitious to become a
missionary in his own right, but neither Whitman nor
Spalding felt he was qualified for such work. In Boston,
Gray was coolly received by the American Board, but the
trip gained him two things: he attended medical college
briefly, and he married Mary Augusta Dix.</p>
<p>At this time the American Board was recruiting the
only reinforcements it was to send to Oregon. In March
1838 Gray and his wife joined this group, and the party
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
headed overland for Oregon. Besides the Grays there
were tall, shy Elkanah Walker and his cheerful wife,
Mary; serious-minded Cushing Eells and his frail-looking
wife, Myra; and fault-finding but intelligent Asa Bowen
Smith and his sickly Sarah. Before they reached St.
Louis, they were joined by Cornelius Rogers, a bachelor.
In addition to the usual hazards, the journey was complicated
by a clashing of strong personalities. One thing
the new missionaries agreed upon, however, was that
none of them wished to be assigned to the same station
as William Gray.</p>
<p>Upon the new missionaries&rsquo; arrival at Waiilatpu, a
meeting was held to decide a course for the future. Agreement
was soon reached on the composition of the stations.
The Grays were to join the Spaldings at Lapwai. The
Smiths and Cornelius Rogers were to stay with the Whitmans.
The Walkers and Eellses, the two couples among
the newcomers who got along best, were to open a new
station to the north among the Spokan Indians near Fort
Colville. But these plans were to be changed in part.</p>
<p>Walker and Eells visited the Spokan tribe that autumn
and selected a site at Tshimakain (&ldquo;the place of springs&rdquo;).
But winter was close at hand, and they returned to
Waiilatpu to await spring. The Grays went to Lapwai,
where Spalding and Gray quarreled throughout the
winter. At Waiilatpu, the Whitmans&rsquo; little house was
crowded to an uncomfortable degree. Although the new
mission house was far enough along for the Smiths to
move into it in December, the first house then had to
make room for the arrival of Mary Walker&rsquo;s first son.</p>
<p>Such crowded conditions were to lead to severe irritations
before the winter was over. The diaries and the
letters home show that hurt feelings were an all too common
occurrence, and feuds began to gnaw at the unity of
the Oregon mission. There were forebodings, which later
proved correct, that the antagonisms of that winter would
hurt the future work of the missionaries.</p>
<p>Among the disagreements was one between Whitman
and Smith. It became evident that the two would not
be able to work together. Always the pacifier, Whitman
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
took the initiative by offering to leave Waiilatpu and
begin a new station. But the arrival of spring brought
a new spirit of cooperation. The Walkers and Eellses
left for Tshimakain, and Whitman and Smith patched
up their relations. Nevertheless, they did separate; but it
was the Smiths who left. Asa and his wife moved to
Kamiah, 50 miles up the Clearwater from Spalding,
where they began a new mission among the Nez Perc&eacute;.
By the summer of 1839 there were four American Board
stations in Oregon: Waiilatpu among the Cayuse; Lapwai
and Kamiah among the Nez Perc&eacute;, and Tshimakain
in the country of the Spokan. Of these, the one most
fully developed and the one destined to be the center for
the Oregon field was Waiilatpu.</p>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small"><i>A Community Rises at Waiilatpu</i></span></h2>
<p>The number of people at Waiilatpu in the winter of
1838-39 convinced Whitman that work on the new
mission house had to be speeded up. Fortunately, he
was able to hire Asahel Munger, who was a skilled carpenter.
Munger had come out to Oregon as an independent
missionary only to find that a person could not be
independent in that vast, unsettled country. He eagerly
accepted Whitman&rsquo;s offer.</p>
<p>The attractive, substantial mission house was built of
the same materials as the first house. The new, T-shaped
building had a wooden frame, walls of adobe bricks,
and a roof of poles, straw, and earth. The walls were
smoothed and whitewashed with a solution made from
river mussel shells. Later, enough paint was acquired
from the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company to paint the doors and
window frames green, the interior woodwork gray, and
the pine floors yellow. The main section of the house
was a story-and-a-half high with three rooms on the
ground floor and space for bedrooms above. From it
extended a long, single-story wing which contained a
kitchen, another bedroom, and a classroom. An out-kitchen,
storeroom, and other facilities were later added
to the wing.</p>

<p><i>The Mission Press</i></p>
<p><i>In 1837 Henry Spalding became the first missionary
to try writing a book in the Nez Perc&eacute; language. But
it was soon discovered that the alphabet devised by him
was not adaptable to the Indians&rsquo; tongue and this 72-page
&ldquo;primer&rdquo; was never printed.</i></p>
<p><i>The next year, having received a new printing press
themselves, the American Board missionaries in Hawaii
(then called the Sandwich Islands) offered an older press
to the Oregon missionaries. This, the first printing press
in the Pacific Northwest, arrived at Lapwai in May 1839.
With it came Edwin Hall who was to assist in starting the
operation.</i></p>
<p><i>Eight days after setting up the press, the missionaries
had proudly produced 400 copies of the first book printed
in old Oregon. The authors, using an adaption of the
alphabet employed in Hawaii, were Henry and Eliza
Spalding and Cornelius Rogers. The significance of this
achievement is not lessened by the fact that this book
had only eight pages.</i></p>
<p><i>Between 1839 and 1845 a total of nine books were
printed. The most elaborate of these was the Gospel
according to St. Matthew turned out in Nez Perc&eacute; by
Spalding. All but one of the books were printed in the
Nez Perc&eacute; language; that one was a 16-page primer in
Spokan translated by Elkanah Walker, the copies being
stitched, pressed, and bound by his wife, Mary. All these
imprints are now quite rare, and of one only a single copy
is known to exist. This is the Nez Perc&eacute; Laws, drawn
up by Indian Agent Elijah White in 1842.</i></p>
<p><i>Reducing the Nez Perc&eacute; language to writing was not
an easy task. Asa Smith, the best linguist in the group,
wrote:</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;[The] number of words in the language is immense
&amp; their variations are almost beyond description. Every
word is limited &amp; definite in its meaning &amp; the great
difficulty is to find terms sufficiently general. Again the
power of compounding words is beyond description.&rdquo;
But even as he struggled with this problem, Smith was
convinced of the necessity of books: &ldquo;We must have books
in the native language, schools, &amp; the Scriptures translated,
or we are but beating the air....&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><i>By 1846 the missionaries had become pessimistic about
their progress in publishing. The amount of effort required
for just a few pages was tremendous. Their best
linguists&mdash;Smith and Cornelius Rogers&mdash;were no longer
with the mission. The Indians were not as receptive to
the printed word as the missionaries had hoped. In that
year the press was moved from Lapwai to The Dalles, and
this first publishing venture came to a close. After the
Whitman massacre, the press was used in the Williamette
Valley by some men who were among the first newspaper
publishers in the Pacific Northwest.</i></p>
<p><i>The immensity of this undertaking can be grasped only
if one remembers the primitiveness of the land in 1839
when the missionaries distributed the first pages ever
printed in the Oregon Country.</i></p>

<p>William Gray, who had moved back to Waiilatpu from
Lapwai, built a third house in 1840-41. Situated 400
feet east of the mission house, it was a neat, rectangular
adobe building. Gray and his wife lived in it only a
short time. In 1842 he decided that his future lay elsewhere
than in the mission field. The Grays moved to
western Oregon where they began an active life as settlers.</p>
<p>Although a blacksmith shop and a gristmill had been
erected at Lapwai to serve all the stations, it became evident
to Whitman that the central location of Waiilatpu
required similar facilities there. In 1841 the blacksmith
equipment was moved from Lapwai, and a small, adobe
shop, 16 by 30 feet, was built half-way between the mission
house and Gray&rsquo;s residence. Its adobe bricks were
taken from the first house, which was torn down at this
time. A corral was also built near this shop.</p>
<p>A small, improvised gristmill was built on the south
side of the mission grounds in 1839. A second, more efficient
mill soon replaced it. With this mill, Whitman
was able to produce enough flour to supply the other stations
and to sell to the emigrants of 1842. In addition,
some of the Cayuse began to bring their grain to the mill.
After Whitman had departed for the United States in
the autumn of 1842, fire destroyed the mill. Not until
1844 did Whitman find the opportunity to build his third
mill. Much larger than the others, the new gristmill had
grinding stones 40 inches in diameter. Later, a threshing
machine and a turning lathe were built on the mill platform.
For waterpower to operate the mill, a ditch was
dug from the Walla Walla River to a millpond formed by
two long earthen dikes.</p>
<p>Although some pine timber had been handsawed in
the Blue Mountains and dragged to the mission by horses,
Whitman felt a dire need for a waterpowered sawmill.
Among other things, he wanted to replace his leaky,
earthen roofs with boards. He picked a spot on a stream
in the foothills about 20 miles from the station and, by
1846, had the mill ready for operation. In 1847 a small
cabin was built at the sawmill to house two emigrant
families whom Whitman hired that autumn for a season
of sawing. Physically, Waiilatpu was fast becoming the
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
most substantial and comfortable of all the stations. From
time to time, the other missionaries were just a shade envious
of the Whitmans.</p>
<p>As the missionaries carried their work into the 1840&rsquo;s,
they continued their efforts among the Indians. Whitman
had his greatest success in teaching them the rudiments
of agriculture. In 1843 he wrote that about 50
Indians had started farms, each cultivating from a quarter
of an acre to three or four. The Cayuse also became
interested in acquiring cattle, and by 1845 nearly all
possessed the beginnings of a herd.</p>
<p>Much slower progress was made in education and religious
instruction. To the Whitmans&rsquo; disappointment,
the Cayuse became less and less interested in learning the
principles of Christianity. The demands made of them
were too great for their simple and seminomadic way of
life. Then, too, the Whitmans found they had less and
less time to devote to Indian affairs. In addition to the
multitude of details involved in the everyday job of acquiring
food and shelter, the arrival of the annual emigrant
trains from the United States demanded much time
and energy from the Whitmans. Waiilatpu became not
only an Indian mission but also an important station on
the Oregon Trail.</p>
<p>At Lapwai, Spalding was having greater success among
the Nez Perc&eacute; and was able to convert several important
Indian leaders. In 1839 he obtained a printing press
from the American Board mission in Hawaii and printed
parts of the Bible in the Nez Perc&eacute; language. Both he
and Asa Smith had difficulty in devising a workable alphabet.
But on the second attempt, they contrived one that
captured the sounds of the Nez Perc&eacute; tongue. At Tshimakain
and Kamiah the work of teaching and converting
Indians proved a laborious and slow task. Although they
recognized the difficulties facing them, the missionaries
clung tenaciously to the idea of preparing the Indians for
the day when white settlers would pour into the fertile
lands of the Far West.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the signs of white migration were becoming
more plentiful at Waiilatpu, situated as it was on the
main route of travel from the East. One of the ways in
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
which this movement was making itself apparent was in
the increasing number of white children who were to be
seen at Whitman&rsquo;s station.</p>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small"><i>The Mission Children</i></span></h2>
<p>On her 29th birthday, March 14, 1837, Narcissa Whitman
gave birth to her only child, a baby girl who was
named Alice Clarissa after her two grandmothers. Alice
was the first child born of United States citizens in the
Pacific Northwest. Her arrival was a great joy not only
to her parents but to the Cayuse as well. The Indians had
been aware of the baby&rsquo;s coming, and after her birth all
the chiefs and elders of the tribe visited the house to see
the <i>temi</i> or &ldquo;Cayuse girl,&rdquo; as they promptly named her
because she was born on their lands.</p>
<p>That autumn the Whitmans took 8-month-old Alice
Clarissa on a visit to the Spaldings at Lapwai. It was
time for Eliza Spalding&rsquo;s first confinement, and Dr. Whitman
had come to officiate. On November 15, the baby
arrived. The Spaldings named their daughter Eliza,
after her mother. Back home again, little Alice Clarissa
provided her parents with untold happiness. But that
happiness was to be tragically short lived. On a fine
Sunday afternoon, June 23, 1839, Alice Clarissa Whitman
met death by drowning. Unattended for a few
minutes, she had wandered down to the steep bank of the
nearby Walla Walla River and had fallen in. Though
her body was found but a short time later, all attempts
to revive her failed. Her heartbroken parents tried to
console themselves with the thought that her demise was
the will of God. Yet their loneliness was immense. Before
long, however, the Whitmans once again had children in
their home to care for and to raise.</p>
<p>The first of these was Helen Mar, the half-breed
daughter of the famous mountain man, Joe Meek. Helen
Mar&rsquo;s Nez Perc&eacute; mother had deserted Meek, and when he
journeyed to Waiilatpu in 1840, he persuaded Mrs. Whitman
to accept the care of the child. The next year,
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
another little part-Indian girl was added to the Whitman
household when another famous mountain man, Jim
Bridger, sent his 6-year-old Mary Ann to the Whitmans.</p>
<p>In 1842 two Indian women brought a &ldquo;miserable-looking
child, a boy between three and four years old,&rdquo; to
Narcissa and asked her to take him in. This boy was
also half-Indian; his Spanish father had once been an
employee of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company. Narcissa tried
to decline the responsibility, but her pity was too great.
Taking the child, she named him after an old friend
back home, David Malin. Then, when Marcus returned
to Oregon in 1843 from his trip East, he brought with
him his 13-year-old nephew, Perrin Whitman. Thus the
Whitmans acquired their fourth youngster.</p>
<p>The next seven children to be added to the household
were all of one family. In 1844 Henry and Naomi Sager
left Missouri with six children. On the trail to Oregon,
Mrs. Sager gave birth to her seventh child. But tragedy
rode with the Sagers. Henry died when the family
reached the Green River; a month later, Mrs. Sager died
near what is now Twin Falls, Idaho. The children, benumbed
by the loss of both parents, were brought on by
the wagon train. The women of the train took turns
caring for the baby, while Dr. Dagan, a German immigrant,
drove the Sager cart with the other six children
toward the Whitmans&rsquo; mission.</p>
<p>For many days, the emigrants&rsquo; wagons had been passing
through Waiilatpu. Just before the seven orphans
came, Narcissa had written home: &ldquo;Here we are, one
family alone, a way mark, as it were, or center post,
about which multitudes will or must gather this winter.&rdquo;
On the morning the children arrived Mrs. Whitman was
called to the yard to greet them. There she witnessed a
poignant scene.</p>
<p>Before the cart stood the four barefoot girls in their
tattered dresses. Afraid of the unknown, they huddled
speechlessly, first looking at Mrs. Whitman then at one
another, not knowing what to expect. John, the older
boy, still sat in the cart. Exhausted but relieved, he bent
his head to his knees and sobbed aloud. His brother,
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
Francis, leaned on a wheel and also began to cry. Dr.
Dagan, who had been both father and mother to the
orphans, stood to one side and, filled with emotion,
watched Narcissa murmur a compassionate welcome.
She then took the children into the mission house.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig22">
<img src="images/p19.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="632" />
<p class="pcap">An Indian woman made this doll for
young Elizabeth Sager.</p>
</div>
<p>At that time Narcissa&rsquo;s health was not good, and she
and Marcus debated that evening whether or not to take
all seven orphans into their family. But the plight of the
children resolved all doubts. The Whitmans now found
themselves directly responsible for a family of 11 children.</p>
<p>In addition to this family, the children of the emigrant
families stopped at the mission each autumn and often
stayed for the winter. Also present were the children
whom the Whitmans took into their school as boarders&mdash;such
as the young lady whom Dr. Whitman had brought
into the world, Eliza Spalding&mdash;and the two Manson
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
boys, the half-breed sons of a Hudson&rsquo;s Bay employee at
Fort Walla Walla. Thus, following the death of Alice
Clarissa, there was always a large number of youthful
voices at Waiilatpu, as indeed there was, to a lesser degree,
at the other missions.</p>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small"><i>Missions in Oregon</i></span></h2>
<p>During the 11 years they operated in Oregon, the
American Board stations continually sent home requests
for lay assistants to help convert the Indian tribes. Despite
these pleas, no additional reinforcements were sent
to Oregon after 1838. On the contrary, the mission
stations were reduced from four to three. Discouraged,
lonely, and increasingly concerned over his wife&rsquo;s health,
Asa Smith left Kamiah in 1841 and sailed for the
Hawaiian Islands. From then until 1847 only Waiilatpu,
Lapwai, and Tshimakain remained in operation.</p>
<p>In western Oregon the Methodist missions, established
with the arrival of Jason Lee in 1834, were suffering
difficulties of their own. Faced with a rapidly diminishing
number of Indians, the Methodists began to concentrate
in the early 1840&rsquo;s on establishing churches among
the new white settlements that were rapidly filling the
Willamette Valley. In 1847 the Methodists offered to
sell their remaining Indian mission, Waskopum at
The Dalles, to the American Board. Whitman, worried
that Catholic missionaries would take over the area if the
American Board did not, agreed to purchase it. Lacking a
missionary to send there, he hired Alanson Hinman and his
wife, from the Willamette Valley, to take charge of secular
affairs and sent his nephew, Perrin, to live with them.</p>
<p>As early as 1834 French Canadian employees and ex-employees
of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company in Oregon had
petitioned the Catholic bishop at Red River in western
Canada for priests. At first the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company
refused to help priests come to Oregon, but in 1838 it
agreed to transport Catholic missionaries across the Rockies
provided that no missions were established south of
the Columbia River.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>The Bishop of Quebec accepted responsibility for sending
Catholic missionaries to the Pacific Northwest. As
soon as the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company agreed to help with
transportation, the bishop sent the Reverend Francis N.
Blanchet to be vicar-general of the new area. Joined at
Red River by Father Modeste Demers, Blanchet arrived
at Fort Vancouver late in 1838.</p>
<p>Because of the company&rsquo;s restriction, Blanchet was
careful not to establish mission stations south of the Columbia.
Before long, however, the restriction was removed,
and a Catholic mission was established at French
Prairie in the Willamette Valley.</p>

<p>During 1839 both Blanchet and Demers made extensive
tours throughout Puget Sound and on the upper
Columbia. While at Fort Colville, near the American
Board station at Tshimakain, Demers learned that an
American priest, Father Peter DeSmet, was in the Flathead
country to the east. Father DeSmet had been sent
out to Oregon by the Bishop of St. Louis in answer to a
call similar to that which had stimulated the Protestant
missions. In 1841 DeSmet founded St. Mary&rsquo;s mission
in the Bitter Root Valley in present-day Montana and,
in the next year, the Sacred Heart mission among the
Coeur d&rsquo;Alene Indians, in what is now Idaho.</p>
<p>By 1842 the Canadian and American Catholic missions
in Oregon were united under the authority of
Blanchet. Soon reinforcements were received from Canada,
the United States, and Europe. In 1844 Francis
Blanchet was designated as bishop and 2 years later was
promoted to archbishop when Oregon was elevated to
an ecclesiastical province. The brother of the archbishop,
A. M. A. Blanchet, was made bishop of Walla Walla. He
arrived at Fort Walla Walla in September 1847, accompanied
by Vicar-General J. B. A. Brouillet, six priests, and
two lay brothers.</p>
<p>The 1830&rsquo;s and 1840&rsquo;s were years of strong antagonisms
between the Protestant and Catholic churches in
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
the United States. The missionaries in Oregon shared
in this feeling. When Marcus Whitman met Bishop
A. M. A. Blanchet at Fort Walla Walla, he was greatly
disturbed by the presence of the Catholic missionaries.</p>

</div>
<p>Bishop Blanchet proceeded to establish St. Ann&rsquo;s mission
among the Cayuse on the Umatilla River and St.
Rose of Lima near the mouth of the Yakima River. The
Catholic missionaries unwittingly had chosen a most unpropitious
time for establishing these missions. Their
beginning was to coincide with the disaster at &ldquo;the place
of the rye grass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the outbreak of violence at Waiilatpu in November
1847, strong anti-Catholic feeling flared up in Oregon
that was to color many minds for years to come. The
troubles at Waiilatpu, however, were not the result of
religious rivalry, and the Catholic missionaries could in
no way be rightfully blamed. The tragedy at the Whitman
station would have occurred had there been no
Catholics in eastern Oregon.</p>
<p>Besides the real and imagined troubles of rival churches
during this decade, the American Board missionaries were
experiencing difficulties within their own ranks. Out of
this dissension came one of the most remarkable cross-country
journeys in American history.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small"><i>The Ride East</i></span></h2>
<p>In September 1842 an alarming letter from the American
Board arrived at Waiilatpu. It ordered the closing
of Waiilatpu and Lapwai and directed Whitman to move
to Tshimakain. Spalding, Gray, and Smith were told to
return home.</p>
<p>These drastic orders were the result of letters written
by Smith, Gray, Rogers, and others, telling the Board
of the many dissensions among the missionaries. Reports
were sent to Boston about Spalding&rsquo;s bitterness toward the
Whitmans, about the feud between Spalding and Gray,
and about Smith&rsquo;s constant faultfinding. They told, too,
of the inability of the missionaries to agree on policies
toward the Indians and toward the independent Protestant
missionaries who strayed into the Northwest. The
letters recounted in painful detail the petty squabbles that
had risen from time to time among all the missionaries.</p>
<p>But before the orders reached Oregon, many of these
problems had already been solved. The missionaries,
realizing the harm coming from dissension, had agreed
to patch up their differences and had had some success
in doing so. The Smiths had long since left the mission,
and the Grays were about to go. Meeting at Waiilatpu
to discuss the orders, the missionaries first decided not to
put the directive into effect until the Board should hear
of the improvements that had been made. This would
take time, for it was not unusual to wait a year or more
for an answer to a letter. Deeply concerned over the
matter, Whitman made the sudden decision that he
should go at once to Boston to talk to the Board&rsquo;s Prudential
Committee. Reluctantly, the other missionaries
agreed.</p>
<p>On October 3 Whitman set out on his remarkable ride
across the continent in the height of winter. Accompanied
by a newly arrived emigrant, Asa Lovejoy, and
an Indian guide, Whitman reached Fort Hall on the
upper Snake River after 15 days of travel. Persuaded
to detour to the south because of rumors of Indian wars
east of the Rockies, the tiny party crossed the Uintah
Mountains to Fort Uintah, in Utah. The hazardous trip
was made through deep snow and in bitter cold.</p>

<p>Following the Uintah, Colorado, and Gunnison Rivers,
Whitman reached Fort Uncompahgre, Colo. From
there, he set out for Taos in northern New Mexico, but
had to return when his guide became lost. Severe winter
storms continued to harass Whitman and Lovejoy, but
by mid-December they reached Taos. On the trail to
Bent&rsquo;s Old Fort on the Arkansas River, they learned that
a group of mountain men were leaving the fort for St.
Louis. Whitman pushed on ahead to catch this party
before it left.</p>
<p>Later when Lovejoy reached the fort, he discovered
that Whitman had not yet arrived. Sending word to
the mountain men to wait, Lovejoy turned back and
found Whitman, who in his haste had become lost.
Exhausted, Lovejoy stayed at Bent&rsquo;s Old Fort until summer,
when he joined Whitman at Fort Laramie for the
return trip to Oregon. On February 15 Whitman
reached Westport, Mo. By March 9 he was in St. Louis,
and about March 23 he arrived in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Even after he reached Boston, Whitman left no written
record of his overland journey. Although Lovejoy did
write about it in later years, his account includes only the
western part of the trip. For the last half of the journey,
we must rely on the accounts of those who saw Whitman
as he traveled toward the American Board headquarters
at Boston. On reaching civilization at St. Louis, it is
probable that he gave up the saddle gladly and traveled
to Washington by steamer and stagecoach.</p>
<p>In Washington, Whitman visited Secretary of the
Treasury J. C. Spencer, an old friend. It is possible, too,
that he was introduced to President John Tyler. This
stopover in Washington caused many people years later
to claim that Dr. Whitman had ridden East to persuade
the government to save Oregon from the British, an
argument not widely accepted today. Most historians
agree that Whitman&rsquo;s ride was to save the missions and
that the trip through Washington was secondary.</p>
<p>The great weakness in the &ldquo;save Oregon&rdquo; theory was
that it failed to distinguish between the reasons for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
trip and the results that came of it. This theory also
tended to link the causes of the journey with the results of
all Whitman&rsquo;s later efforts in Oregon, including assistance
to the American emigrants and the development of Waiilatpu
as an important way station on the Oregon Trail.</p>
<p>When Marcus Whitman arrived at New York City
about March 25, he was interviewed by Horace Greeley,
the famed editor of the <i>Tribune</i>. At New York the
doctor boarded the <i>Narragansett</i> and sailed to Boston,
where he arrived March 30. Despite the rough seas of
the Atlantic coast, this part of the extraordinary trip
must have seemed calm to Whitman after the hundreds
of miles on horseback through the winter snows of the
Rocky Mountains and the western prairie&mdash;a journey of
hardships rarely paralleled in American history.</p>
<p>In the office of the American Board Whitman was
greeted with coldness, but the Board agreed to listen to
his reports and arguments in favor of the Oregon field.
In all respects, Whitman&rsquo;s visit was a successful one. The
Board rescinded the unfavorable orders and agreed to
send reinforcements to Oregon if suitable persons could
be found.</p>
<p>His task accomplished and a hasty visit paid to his
home, Whitman began his return trip to Oregon in April
1843. At Independence, Mo., he joined that year&rsquo;s migration
of almost 1,000 people who were preparing to
follow the Oregon Trail.</p>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small"><i>A Caravan on the Oregon Trail</i></span></h2>
<p>The wagon train of 1843 was the largest yet to assemble
for the trip to Oregon. Its way had been paved by the
triumphs and failures of the fur traders, adventurers,
missionaries, and settlers who had gone before. Back in
1832, Capt. Benjamin Bonneville had taken 20 wagons
beyond the Continental Divide. However, he did not
attempt to take them to the Columbia River, which he
visited in 1834 and again in 1835. In 1836 Whitman and
Spalding set a new milestone by taking a light wagon,
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
by then converted to a two-wheeled cart, as far west as
Fort Boise.</p>
<p>The first wagons reached the Columbia in 1840. They
were brought from Fort Hall, where earlier travelers had
abandoned them, by a group of mountain men who were
on their way to settle in the Willamette Valley. The
trail was so rough that the men finally stripped the wagons
down to their bare frames to get through the sagebrush.
The next year an emigrant train of more than
100 people, led by Dr. Elijah White, reached the Columbia,
but their wagons were taken only as far west
as Fort Hall. It was the caravan of 1843 that brought
all these efforts to fulfillment by taking its wagons intact
to the Columbia. One of the reasons for this success
was Dr. Whitman.</p>
<p>In May 1843 the emigrants held a general meeting
at Independence to plan the organization of the wagons.
For better control, it was eventually decided to divide
the train into two parts: an advance group unencumbered
by livestock, and a slower group that would take
the cattle. Beyond Fort Hall, where the danger from
Indian attack was much less, the train was to split into
smaller units, each to proceed at its own speed. The emigrants
also appointed a committee to talk to Dr. Whitman
to obtain advice on the journey. From his own
experiences, Whitman was in a position to offer many
sound suggestions.</p>
<p>While the caravan crossed the prairie during June and
July, Marcus Whitman remained behind with the cow
column. But when the lead wagons reached the mountains
in the first week of August, he moved up to the
advance party. From then on Whitman was active in
helping to guide the train westward. He assisted in finding
the easiest fords and in crossing the rivers. He pushed
on ahead to locate and mark the best routes. Whenever
necessary, he treated the sick and the lame. Above all,
he constantly urged the emigrants, some of whom were
experiencing great discouragement, to keep on pushing
westward so that they would reach Oregon before winter
set in. At Fort Hall, the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company trader,
Richard Grant, in good faith advised the emigrants to
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
leave their wagons there. But Whitman insisted that
the wagons could be taken to the Columbia. Catching
his enthusiasm, the emigrants formally hired the doctor
to lead them the rest of the way. From Fort Hall to the
Grande Ronde Valley, he went ahead of the train marking
the route for the wagons to follow.</p>
<p>Just before the difficult crossing of the Blue Mountains,
Whitman received word by messenger to hurry to Lapwai
where both Henry and Eliza Spalding were seriously ill.
To help the emigrants in crossing the mountains, he persuaded
them to accept as a guide an outstanding Cayuse
leader named Stickus. This chief faithfully and carefully
guided the wagons across the timber-covered range and
on to the mission station.</p>
<p>After a fast ride to Lapwai, Whitman treated the Spaldings,
then hurried on to Waiilatpu. He arrived home
on September 28, just 5 days short of a year since he had
started on his trip. Stopping only long enough to notice
that the first of the emigrant wagons had already arrived,
the doctor mounted his horse once more in answer to another
summons and rode to the Tshimakain mission to
deliver Myra Eells of a son.</p>
<p>By the time Whitman again returned to Waiilatpu,
most of the emigrants had already stopped at the mission
and had gone on to the Columbia. From the mission&rsquo;s
storerooms, the travelers had refurnished their supplies
with wheat, corn, potatoes, beef, and pork raised at
Waiilatpu.</p>
<p>This migration of 1843 confirmed Marcus Whitman&rsquo;s
thoughts that his mission was to be an important way
station on the Oregon Trail. From then on, by the time
emigrants reached the Walla Walla Valley each autumn
many were sick, exhausted, or suffering from hunger.
Marcus and Narcissa welcomed these people, whether
they stopped overnight or stayed for the winter. The
sick and injured were treated; produce from the fields
was sold or given to the needy; worn-out horses and cattle
were replaced with fresh ones from the mission&rsquo;s
herd. A few, not yet aware of the high cost in the Far
West of food, tools, and other things needed by the emigrants,
criticized Whitman for being mercenary, but most
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
visitors praised him for his aid. He turned no one away.
Whitman felt it was his special responsibility to care for
the destitute and the sick.</p>
<p>The Oregon Trail was repeatedly changed with the
discovery of shortcuts during these years. In 1845 the
majority of the emigrants by-passed the mission when a
trail was opened down the Umatilla River past present-day
Pendleton, Oreg. But each autumn many of the
wagons still turned toward Waiilatpu for shelter. The
famous as well as the unknown came to the mission: T. J.
Farnham, emigrant leader; Capt. John Charles Fr&eacute;mont,
army explorer; Paul Kane, artist; and John Sutter, of later
California fame. These and hundreds more found comfort
and aid at Waiilatpu.</p>
<p>Because Whitman was back at his station and relations
among the missionaries were greatly improved, the next
few years seemed to be good ones for the Oregon mission.
But, despite the outward signs of success, troubles were
breeding that would lead to tragedy.</p>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small"><i>The Gathering Storm</i></span></h2>
<p>One of the results of the increasing number of emigrants
on the Oregon Trail was the Cayuse&rsquo;s conviction
that their way of life was in danger. Although the emigrants,
up to now, had continued on to the rich Willamette
Valley, the Indians feared the day when the
settlers would stop on Cayuse land. The Cayuse were
quick to identify the Whitmans with the tide of settlers.
Tom Hill, a Delaware Indian living among the nearby
Nez Perc&eacute;, contributed to this conviction. He told the
Cayuse that before long the emigrants would be taking
their lands. This, after all, was what had happened to
his own people. He also said that the Whitmans were
becoming rich from the sale of their produce to the travelers,
and he argued that this wealth should be used in
helping the Indians.</p>
<p>The Cayuse&rsquo;s concerns were intensified by the increasing
interest Dr. Whitman was showing in the emigrants.
The doctor himself foresaw that the Indians&rsquo; mode of living
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
would not be able to withstand the encroachments
of the aggressive settlers for very long. It seemed obvious
to him that the future of Oregon belonged to the whites.
As Whitman turned his attention more and more to the
problems of emigration, which he was forced to do by
the very presence of the travelers, there was naturally a
decrease in the time and effort he could devote to the
Indians. Furthermore, the results of more than 10 years
labor among the Cayuse offered little encouragement,
and he feared that the future would be little better. The
Cayuse were quick to sense this change. When they did,
they lost their faith in the purpose of the mission and in
the missionaries themselves.</p>
<p>These growing resentments and suspicions were heightened
in the autumn of 1847 when a measles epidemic
spread from that year&rsquo;s wagon train to Cayuse villages.
This was a new disease for the Cayuse, and their bodies
had little resistance to it. The effect of the disease in
the lodges was disastrous. Within 2 months about half
the Cayuse tribe died from measles or from the accompanying
dysentery, though the Whitmans tried desperately
to relieve the suffering. Panic stricken, the Cayuse lost
completely their faith in Whitman&rsquo;s medicine and turned
to their traditional treatments. A sweat bath, followed
by a plunge into the cold river, practically assured their
immediate death.</p>
<p>With the wagons of 1847, a half-breed named Joe
Lewis had arrived at Waiilatpu. Whitman soon learned
that Lewis was a troublemaker, but had no success in
getting rid of him. When the epidemic struck, Lewis
told the Cayuse that Whitman was spreading poison in
the air to kill off the tribe. He said that when all the
Indians were dead, Whitman was going to take their
lands for himself. The more desperate of the Indians
believed Lewis and decided to rid themselves of the doctor
who now seemed a man of evil design. In this belief,
they were encouraged by Nicholas Finley, another
half-breed living near the mission. His lodge, a few
hundred feet from the mission house, became a headquarters
for the malcontents.</p>
<p>In the minds of these Cayuse there was no question of
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
their right to dispose of Dr. Whitman. One of the practices
of the tribe for generations was that if a patient of a
medicine man, or <i>tewat</i>, should die, the sick person&rsquo;s relative
could seek revenge by killing the <i>tewat</i>. Since measles
was a white man&rsquo;s disease and since Whitman, a white
doctor, surely knew the cure, they believed that he was
deliberately withholding that cure from them. Their
people were dying, and revenge should be extracted from
<i>tewat</i> Whitman.</p>
<p>The Whitmans had long been aware of the dangers
that faced them because of the Indians&rsquo; attitude toward
medicine. But, with their high sense of obligation and
responsibility, they had threaded their way through the
maze of superstitions, sometimes at great risks, but always
with success&mdash;until 1847.</p>
<p>Although the majority of the Cayuse had become concerned
with the events of that autumn, only a few extremists
took part in planning an attack on the mission.
As November 1847 drew to a close both the whites at
the mission and the Cayuse leaders knew that a crisis was
at hand. This crisis grew out of a conflict between two
groups holding opposing ideas, each believing itself to be
right. The Whitmans believed they were fulfilling a
destiny that God had determined for them. The Cayuse
believed they were doing what was necessary to defend
and preserve their land and their way of life.</p>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small"><i>The Massacre</i></span></h2>
<p>When Monday, November 29, 1847, dawned cold and
foggy in the Walla Walla Valley, there were 74 people
staying at the Waiilatpu mission. Most of them were
emigrants, stopping over on the way to the Willamette
Valley. The mission buildings were crowded almost beyond
capacity: 23 people were living in the mission
house; 8 in the blacksmith shop; 29 in the emigrant
house; 12 in the cabin at the sawmill, 20 miles up Mill
Creek; and the 2 half-breeds, Lewis and Finley, were
living in lodges on the mission grounds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>The Whitmans, aware that a crisis was at hand, had
discussed what they should do. Both Marcus and Narcissa
rejected the idea of attempting flight. Dr. Whitman
believed that if the Cayuse went on the rampage
only he would be involved and the others would not suffer
on his behalf. Courageously, the missionaries decided to
continue administering to the sick and to attempt to keep
peace with the Indians. On that Monday morning,
Marcus treated the ill and officiated at the funeral of an
Indian child. Narcissa, ill and temporarily despondent,
remained in her room until nearly noon, not touching the
breakfast brought to her.</p>

</div>
<p>After lunch Whitman stayed in the living room, resting
and reading. Narcissa, feeling better, was in the
room also, bathing one of the Sager girls. Throughout
the rest of the mission, the duties of the day were being
carried out. Several children were in the classroom where
L. W. Saunders had begun to teach that day after a
forced vacation caused by the measles epidemic. Isaac
Gilliland, a tailor, was working in the emigrant house on
a suit of clothes for Dr. Whitman. At the end of the
east wing of the mission house, Peter Hall was busy laying
a floor in a new addition being built that autumn. Out
in the yard, Walter Marsh was running the gristmill,
and four men were busy dressing a beef. There were
more Indians than usual gathered about the grounds that
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
day, but it was thought they had been attracted by the
butchering.</p>
<p>Into this scene walked two Cayuse chiefs, Tiloukaikt
and Tomahas. They entered the mission house kitchen
and knocked on the bolted door that led to the living
room, claiming they wanted medicine. Dr. Whitman
refused them entry but got some medicine from the
closet under the stairway. Warning Mrs. Whitman to
lock the door behind him, he went out into the kitchen.
There, Tiloukaikt deliberately provoked the doctor into
an argument. While the doctor&rsquo;s attention was thus diverted,
Tomahas suddenly attacked him from behind with
a tomahawk. Whitman struggled to save himself but
soon collapsed from the blows.</p>
<p>Mary Ann Bridger, in the kitchen at this moment,
dashed out the north door, ran around the building to the
west entrance of the living room, and cried out in terror,
&ldquo;They have killed father!&rdquo; John Sager, the oldest of the
seven orphans, was also in the kitchen when the two Indians
fell upon the doctor. John, recovering from the
measles, had been busy preparing twine for new brooms.
When the doctor was attacked, John attempted to reach
for a pistol but was assaulted by the Indians before he
could get it. He fell to the floor mortally wounded. At
this time, a shot rang out that was apparently the signal
for an attack by the Indians in the yard.</p>
<p>At the sound of the shot, the Indians dropped their
blankets, which had concealed guns and tomahawks, and
began their attack on the men at the mission. Saunders,
the school teacher, was killed while trying to reach his
wife in the emigrant house. Hoffman, one of the butchers,
was killed while furiously defending himself with an
ax. Gilliland, the tailor, was killed in the room where he
had been sewing. Marsh was killed working at the gristmill.
Francis Sager, the second oldest of the family, was
in the schoolroom when the attack began. With the
other children, he hid in the rafters above the room.
Before long he was discovered by Joe Lewis, and soon he
too was shot and killed.</p>
<p>Two others&mdash;Kimball who also was working on the
beef, and Andrew Rodgers who was down by the river&mdash;were
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
wounded; but both were able to reach the mission
house where Narcissa let them into the living room. A few
minutes later, Mrs. Whitman, looking though the window
in the east door, saw Joe Lewis in the yard. She called
out to him asking if all this was his doing. Lewis made
no reply, but an Indian standing on the schoolroom steps
heard her voice and, raising his rifle, fired. The bullet
hit Mrs. Whitman in the left breast. She fell to the floor
screaming but quickly recovered her composure and
staggered to her feet.</p>
<p>Narcissa gathered those about her, including several
children and the two wounded men, and led them upstairs
just as the Indians burst into the living room. In
the attic bedroom, a broken, discarded musket was found,
and the refugees used it to fend off the Indians. Finally,
Tamsucky, an old Indian whom the Whitmans had long
trusted, convinced Narcissa that the mission house was
about to be burned and that all must go to the emigrant
house for safety.</p>
<p>Narcissa and Rodgers agreed to come downstairs, but
for the time being the children and the wounded Kimball
were to stay. At the foot of the stairs Narcissa caught a
glimpse of her husband who now lay dead, his face horribly
mutilated. Shocked and weak from loss of blood,
she lay down upon a settee. Rodgers and Joe Lewis
picked up the settee and carried Mrs. Whitman outdoors.
Just beyond the north door of the kitchen, Lewis suddenly
dropped his end of the settee, and a number of Indians
standing there began firing at Narcissa and Rodgers.
After her body had rolled off the couch into the mud, one
Indian grabbed her hair, lifted her head, and struck her
face with his riding whip. Mrs. Whitman probably
died quickly, but Rodgers lingered on into the night.</p>
<p>Kimball remained upstairs with the children through
the long night. In the early dawn of Tuesday, he slipped
down to the river to get water for them. But he was discovered
by the Indians and killed. On that same day,
unaware of what had happened, James Young drove
down from the sawmill with a load of lumber. He was
caught a mile or to from the mission and slain on the
spot. A few days later two more victims were added
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
when the Indians killed Crockett Bewley and Amos Sales,
two sick youths who dared to openly criticize the Cayuse
for the massacre. These two young men brought the
death total to 13.</p>
<p>Peter Hall, the carpenter working on the house, managed
to escape when the Indians attacked. He made
his way to Fort Walla Walla where he received help
from the trader, William McBean. Departing from
there, he started across the Columbia River to make his
way down the north bank to Fort Vancouver. But he
never arrived. Perhaps he drowned in the Columbia, perhaps
he was caught and killed. Nothing further is known
about him.</p>
<p>A few of the people at the mission made successful escapes.
W. D. Canfield, one of those dressing the beef,
managed to hide in the blacksmith shop until nightfall.
Then he set out on foot for Lapwai, 110 miles away.
Though he had only a general knowledge of the trail and
the direction, he reached Spalding&rsquo;s mission on Saturday.
But the most desperate escape was that of the Osborn
family. Josiah Osborn, his wife, and their three children
were living in the &ldquo;Indian Room&rdquo; of the mission house.
When the attack came, Osborn hid himself and his family
under some loose boards in the floor and escaped detection
throughout the afternoon and evening. Crouched
under the floor, they could hear the groans of the dying
and the sounds of looting above their heads.</p>
<p>After the coming of darkness when the rooms above
them grew quiet, the Osborns came out of hiding and
made their way silently to the river. They started walking
to Fort Walla Walla, but after a short distance, Mrs.
Osborn, who had just recovered from measles and the
loss of a child at its birth, could not go on. Hiding his
wife and two of the children in the willows, Osborn continued
on to the fort where he eventually was able to get
a horse and a friendly Indian to help him. After some
difficulty, he found his family where he had left them and
took his wife and children on to Fort Walla Walla. The
Osborns did not reach the security of the fort until Thursday&mdash;after
4 days in the damp cold of an Oregon autumn.
Sick and afraid, all five of the family survived
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
the ordeal and eventually reached the Willamette Valley.</p>
<p>At Waiilatpu, the Cayuse were exultant. They had
destroyed what they believed had been the cause of all
their troubles; once again their lands would be free from
the tracks of wagon wheels and the unfathomable ideas
of the whites.</p>
<p>Their victory was to be but a short respite. Before
long, the Cayuse were to suffer heavily for these deeds.
They could not foresee that Marcus and Narcissa Whitman
would be regarded as martyrs by their countrymen.
They did not understand that Americans could and
would wreak a terrible vengeance.</p>

</div>
<p>With the exception of David Malin and the two Manson
boys, whom the Indians allowed to go to Fort Walla
Walla, they held all 49 survivors captive at Waiilatpu.
Although most of them suffered greatly from shock and
were fearful of the future, most of the captives were not
treated severely. Three of the older girls were singled
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
out by Indians who desired them for wives. Especially
maltreated was Lorinda Bewley who was subjected to the
unwanted attentions of Five Crows, a chief who had not
participated in the attack and who had long enjoyed many
favors from the Whitmans. During their captivity, two
young girls died&mdash;Louise Sager and Helen Mar Meek.
Both these children had been critically ill with measles
before the massacre, and it is possible they would have
died even with Dr. Whitman present to care for them.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the day following the attack, Joe Stanfield
dug a shallow, mass grave near the mission cemetery
north of the mission house. On the same day, Father
Brouillet, one of the priests whose arrival in the vicinity
a few weeks earlier had so greatly disturbed Dr. Whitman,
reached Waiilatpu. Horrified by the scene of death and
destruction, Brouillet helped Stanfield prepare the dead.
Rendering &ldquo;to those unfortunate victims the last service
in my power to offer them,&rdquo; Brouillet officiated at the
burial. A few days later wild animals disturbed the shallow
grave, and it had to be covered again. In March
1848 the remains, which again had been disturbed by
wolves, were placed in a new grave and covered with
an upturned wagon bed by the Oregon Volunteers. On
the 50th anniversary of the massacre, the bodies were
disinterred and reburied in a more fitting tomb, where
they lie today.</p>
<p>News of the massacre reached Fort Vancouver early
in December. Moving quickly, Chief Factor James
Douglas sent Peter Skene Ogden up the Columbia with
a supply of goods to bargain for the release of the captives.
On December 29, one month after the massacre, the
prisoners were exchanged for 62 blankets, 63 shirts, 12
guns, 600 loads of ammunition, 37 pounds of tobacco,
and 12 flints.</p>
<p>None of the other American Board missions were attacked.
On January 1, 1848, the Nez Perc&eacute; escorted
the Spaldings to Fort Walla Walla, where they joined
the 49 Waiilatpu survivors for the journey to Willamette.
The Eellses and Walkers continued to live among the
Spokan until the following spring when they, too, left for
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
Oregon City. Thus the activities of the American Board
came to an end in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>When Gov. George Abernethy, head of the provisional
government in Oregon Territory, heard of the massacre,
a company of riflemen was enrolled to punish the Cayuse.
Soon the call was increased to 500 volunteers. At the end
of February the volunteer soldiers reached the Walla
Walla Valley. The Cayuse fled to the mountains north
of the Snake River, but the disorganized and poorly disciplined
troops did not pursue them far. These volunteers
stayed at Waiilatpu until early summer. Then,
leaving behind a guard of 50 men at the mission&mdash;by
now called Fort Waters&mdash;the rest returned home.</p>
<p>After 2 years of wandering and hardships, the Cayuse
gave up five of their men in an effort to make peace with
the whites. These five were arrested for murder and
tried by jury in Oregon City. All five were found guilty
(although one of them probably took no part in the
massacre) and were hanged in 1850. There is bitter
irony in the fact that the hangman was Joe Meek, the
father of Helen Mar. The Indians&rsquo; problems were not
solved by the hanging. In fact, the time of troubles was
just starting. For the next generation intermittent Indian
wars plagued the Pacific Northwest; but the Cayuse
were never again a source of real trouble.</p>
<p>At the time that he dispatched the Oregon Volunteers,
Governor Abernethy and the provisional legislature sent
emissaries to Washington (led by Joe Meek) to call attention
to the state of affairs in Oregon. News of the
massacre moved Congress to act, and in August 1848
a bill was passed creating the Territory of Oregon. Thus
did Marcus and Narcissa Whitman serve the Pacific
Northwest and their country after death.</p>
<p>Alive, they had striven to prepare the Cayuse for the
civilization that was sure to engulf them. When the
emigrants did arrive, the Whitman mission became a
haven in the wilderness for these weary wanderers. The
Whitmans&rsquo; deaths had the immediate result of creating
the first formal American territorial government west of
the Rocky Mountains. Today, the story of the Whitmans
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
serves to inspire all people who would pursue the way
of high principles and ideals. Events at Waiilatpu were
climaxed with disaster, but from this tragedy there shines
a rare courage, dedication, and strength that men will
ever need.</p>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small"><i>Preservation of the Past</i></span></h2>
<p>For a brief time in 1848, the Oregon Volunteers occupied
the mission in their unsuccessful campaign to punish
the Cayuse. Building an adobe wall around the
mission house, they named it Fort Waters. In 1859 the
Reverend Cushing Eells, the former associate of Dr.
Whitman, established a claim on the former mission site
and lived there until 1872, when his house burned down.
His great achievement during these years was the founding
of Whitman Seminary (now Whitman College) in
the new community of Walla Walla, 6 miles east of the
mission site.</p>
<p>For the next few generations the land that Dr. Whitman
first tilled continued to be farmed by a number of
owners. In 1897, on the 50th anniversary of the massacre,
Mr. and Mrs. Marion Willard Swegle donated
about 8 acres, including the site of the Great Grave and
the Memorial Shaft Hill, to a group of citizens interested
in perpetuating that historic spot. As the 100th anniversary
of the Whitmans&rsquo; arrival at Waiilatpu approached,
public-spirited citizens initiated efforts to
acquire and preserve the land on which the mission itself
had been located. In 1936 the Whitman Centennial
Co. acquired 37&frac12; additional acres of land, which included
the building sites. These two tracts were donated
to the Nation, and on January 20, 1940, Whitman National
Monument was formally established.</p>
<p>In 1961 an additional 45 acres of land were purchased
by the Federal Government, pursuant to an Act of Congress,
to permit the proper development of the monument.
In 1962 Congress changed the name of this area to Whitman
Mission National Historic Site.</p>

<h3><i>About Your Visit</i></h3>
<p>Whitman Mission National Historic Site is 6 miles west
of Walla Walla, Wash., just off U.S. 410. Walla
Walla is served by an airline, two railroads, and bus-lines.
Since there is no public transportation between the
town and the monument, you must arrange your own
transportation between these two points.</p>
<p>The grounds of the historic site are open from 8 a.m.
until dark. A self-guiding system of trails enables you to
tour the mission grounds and see the great grave and the
memorial shaft. Markers, pictures, wayside exhibits, and
an audio system are located along the trails. Special
guide service is available to groups making advance arrangements
with the superintendent. In summer, free
guided tours are usually available on weekends without
prior arrangement.</p>
<p>A visitor center housing a museum and a small auditorium
is open from 8 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. every day
except Christmas. The museum tells the story of the
missionaries in the Pacific Northwest, especially that of
the Whitmans. Illustrated talks about the missionary era
and special programs are given in the auditorium. Uniformed
personnel are stationed at the visitor center, where
free informational literature and sales publications of
special historical interest are available.</p>
<h3><i>Administration</i></h3>
<p><span class="sc">Whitman Mission National Historic Site</span> is administered
by the National Park Service, U.S. Department
of the Interior.</p>
<p>The National Park System, of which this Site is a unit,
is dedicated to conserving the scenic, scientific, and historic
heritage of the United States for the benefit and
inspiration of the people.</p>
<p>Development of the site is part of <span class="small">MISSION 66</span>, a dynamic
conservation program to unfold the full potential
of the National Park System for the use and enjoyment
of present and future generations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>A superintendent, whose address is Whitman Mission
National Historic Site, Route 2, Walla Walla, Wash.,
99362, and whose offices are in the visitor center, is in
immediate charge.</p>

<h3><i>America&rsquo;s Natural Resources</i></h3>
<p>Created in 1849, the Department of the Interior&mdash;America&rsquo;s
Department of Natural Resources&mdash;is concerned
with the management, conservation, and development
of the Nation&rsquo;s water, wildlife, mineral, forest, and
park and recreational resources. It also has major responsibilities
for Indian and territorial affairs.</p>
<p>As the Nation&rsquo;s principal conservation agency, the
Department works to assure that nonrenewable resources
are developed and used wisely, that park and recreational
resources are conserved, and that renewable resources
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
make their full contribution to the progress, prosperity,
and security of the United States&mdash;now and in the future.</p>
<h3><i>Related Areas</i></h3>
<p>Included in the National Park System are these other
areas commemorating phases of early western history:

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given

not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
